Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a web designer, developer, security researcher, and have experience triaging for numerous vulnerability disclosure programs. In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, photography, cinematography, and playing the guitar.

In 2017, I published an Internet Draft for a proposed standard which allows websites to define security policies called [security.txt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt). A year later, I created [Bug Bounty Guide](https://bugbountyguide.com/), a launchpad for bug bounty programs and bug bounty hunters.
