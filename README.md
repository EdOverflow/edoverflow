Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a **web designer**, **developer**, **security researcher**, and have
experience triaging for numerous vulnerability disclosure programmes.

In 2016, I joined [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/)â€™s Blue Team where I
operated their bug bounty programme. Subsequently, in 2018, I joined
[HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/) as a Security Analyst. While at
HackerOne, I had the privilege of triaging in-person alongside organisations
such as GitHub, Salesforce, and the United States Marine Corps.

Currently, I am a Senior Pentester at [Cure53](https://cure53.de/), where I use
my expertise to help clients strengthen their security posture by conducting
security audits and source code reviews.

Outside of work, I enjoy staying active and maintaining a strong dedication to
[swimming](https://edoverflow.com/swimming/), honed during my time as a student
on the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/)â€™s [Sports
Scholarship](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/sport/active/campus/teamwarwick/scholarships/scholarship-athletes/edwin-foudil)
programme.
