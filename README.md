Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a **web designer**, **developer**, **security researcher**, and have
experience triaging for numerous vulnerability disclosure programmes.

In 2016, I joined [**Gratipay**](https://gratipay.com/)'s Blue Team where I operated
their bug bounty programme. Subsequently, in 2018, I joined
[**HackerOne**](https://www.hackerone.com/) as a Security Analyst. While at
HackerOne, I had the privilege of triaging in-person alongside organisations
such as: GitHub, Salesforce, and the United States Marine Corps.

I am currently a Senior Pentester at [**Cure53**](https://cure53.de/) and a
student at the [**University of Warwick**](https://warwick.ac.uk/).
