Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a **web designer**, **developer**, **security researcher**, and have experience triaging for numerous vulnerability disclosure programs.

In 2016, I joined [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/)'s Blue Team where I operated their bug bounty programme. Subsequently, in 2018, I joined [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/) as a Security Analyst. While at HackerOne, I had the privilege of triaging in-person alongside organisations such as: GitHub, Salesforce, and the United States Marine Corps.

In 2017, I published an Internet Draft for a proposed standard which allows websites to define security policies called [security.txt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt). A year later, I created [Bug Bounty Guide](https://bugbountyguide.com/), a launchpad for bug bounty programs and bug bounty hunters.
